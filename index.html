        <h1>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Mohamadi Naena. I'm a software engineer. I work mostly on the backend, but I think
            you can already tell from the simplistic website design :). I'm passionate about technology 
            and coding, and for the last three years I've been designing and implementing software 
            solutions that serve hundreds of users and empower businesses. I also like to work on 
            personal projects, play video games, and go out and have fun. Further progressing in my 
            career is very important to me. I'm always trying to improve my skills and knowledge, and 
            I'm always on the lookout for great opportunities to showcase my skills. If you feel that I 
            could be a good fit for what you're trying to do, reach out to me and let's have a talk.

        <h1>My Work</h1>
        <p>Throughout my three-year journey in tech, I've worked on backend systems to solve and build 
            solutions to real-life problems. I've worked in different industries like AI-powered 
            platforms, marketing, and currently branching into the fitness industry. I've enjoyed each 
            phase and learnt a lot, not just from the technical standpoint but also on the business side.
            I've used multiple stacks, technologies, and tools so far, and I'm always willing to learn 
            new ones and quickly adapt to different environments, whatever gets the job done, 
            as I always say.
